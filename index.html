  <h1>Exploring Park Perception in Oakland</h1> 
  
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Parks are one of the few <span style = 'color:#439934'>"free-to-be"</span> places in our   cities and towns. They are integral to health and well-being by <span style = 'color:#439934'>integral to health and well-being</span> by providing space for physical activity and been shown to help reduce stress. They've been connected to lower cawrdiovascular disease risk factors, Type 2 diabetes prevalence, and heat-related mortality risk. </p>
  
  <p>They also provide a <span style = 'color:#439934'>space for community,</span> whether folks are there to hang out wiht friends and family or to be alone but amongst neighbors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people became much more aware of this important role of parks.     </p>
  <p>
  Environmental "hard" data metrics of parks like vegation index and tree canopy cover are   often used in characterizing parks. Park access is also a prominent data point in recent years with statewide initiatives like CA Parks for All. <br> <br>
  
  This exploration seeks to utilize what we've learned in this class to explore more nuance in the data regarding park access. </p>
  
  <h2>Research Question</h2>
  <ol>
    <li value = "1"> What amenities are in Oakland's parks? </li>
    <li>How are Oakland's parks perceived?</li>
    <li>Are there certain features that are related to higher rating?</li>
    <li>What kinds of activities?</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    We used the following data sources for our analysis. In the table below, we list the data used as well as the limitation we experienced for each of the data source. <br> <br>
    <table class = style1 style = "width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th bgcolor = '#439934'>Source</th>
        <th bgcolor = '#439934'>Data Used</th>
        <th bgcolor = '#439934'>Limitation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>OpenStreetMap</td>
        <td>Park names and amenities data for all Oakland parks, road network, and bus stop locations</td>
        <td>User-defined so defintion of parks varied and amenities were only included if someone contributed</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Yelp</td>
        <td>Reviews and ratings of Oakland parks through Yelp API</td>
        <td>Smallest dataset. Only 12 parks in Oakland have Yelp reviews</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Google Maps</td>
        <td>Average ratings and number of reviews of each Oakland park</td>
        <td>Could not get Google's API so limited to only the ratings. But had much more data points than 12 (119 to be exact!)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>City of Oakland</td>
        <td>Map of parks dataset - Official Park Names</td>
        <td>Dataset had typos and inconsistencies. This data source was not used in the final analysis, but did aid in some cross-checking</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    
    We took the following steps to clean and analysis our data. <br> <br>
    <!-- Not sure if we still want to show methodology as a table or just steps-->
    <table class = "style2", style = "width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Step 1</th>
        <th>Step 2</th>
        <th>Step 3</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>OpenStreetMap</td>
        <td>After pulling OSM data, we spatially joined the data with parks</td>
        <td>Cleaned any errors from the spatial join and dropped any outlier amenities</td>
        <td>Resulted in 10 types of park amenities</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Yelp</td>
        <td>Pulled ratings and reviews of parks in Oakland</td>
        <td>Filtered out any non-Oakland parks, filtered out filler words, created thematic word lists</td>
        <td>Created visuals!</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Google Maps</td>
        <td>Pulled ratings of parks in Oakland</td>
        <td>Cross-referenced the parks with the OSM Parks Data and removed null reviews</td>
        <td>Conducted a linear regression with the average ratings and amenity types</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  <br> <br>
  Additionally, we overlayed the parks with the priority neighborhood and analyze the relationship between priority neighborhoods and parks, parks amenities, and park reviews. 
  
  </p>
  
  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <h3>OSM Amenities</h3>
  <p>
    The following images show all the amenities present as result of the spatial join. We found that there were multiple outliers and non-park related amenities present. We condense this list down to 10 main amenities:
    <ul>    
      <li>BBQ Grills</li>
      <li>Benches</li>
      <li>Drinking Fountain</li>
      <li>Toilets</li>
      <li>Bie Parking</li>
      <li>Trash bins</li>
      <li>Community center</li>
      <l>Picnic Tables</l>
      <li>Shelters</li>
      <li>Theatre like outdoor amphitheater</li>
    </ul>
