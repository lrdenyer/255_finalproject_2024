  <h1>Exploring Park Perception in Oakland</h1> 
  
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Parks are one of the few <span style = 'color:#439934'>"free-to-be"</span> places in our   cities and towns. They are integral to health and well-being by <span style = 'color:#439934'>integral to health and well-being</span> by providing space for physical activity and been shown to help reduce stress. They've been connected to lower cawrdiovascular disease risk factors, Type 2 diabetes prevalence, and heat-related mortality risk. </p>
  
  <p>They also provide a <span style = 'color:#439934'>space for community,</span> whether folks are there to hang out wiht friends and family or to be alone but amongst neighbors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people became much more aware of this important role of parks.     </p>
  <p>
  Environmental "hard" data metrics of parks like vegation index and tree canopy cover are   often used in characterizing parks. Park access is also a prominent data point in recent years with statewide initiatives like CA Parks for All. <br> <br>
  
  This exploration seeks to utilize what we've learned in this class to explore more nuance in the data regarding park access. </p>
  
  <h2>Research Question</h2>
  <ol>
    <li value = "1"> What amenities are in Oakland's parks? </li>
    <li>How are Oakland's parks perceived?</li>
    <li>Are there certain features that are related to higher rating?</li>
    <li>What kinds of activities?</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    We used the following data sources for our analysis. In the table below, we list the data used as well as the limitation we experienced for each of the data source.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Source</th>
        <th>Data Used</th>
        <th>Limitation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>OpenStreetMap</td>
        <td>Park names and amenities data for all Oakland parks, road network, and bus stop locations</td>
        <td>User-defined so defintion of parks varied and amenities were only included if someone contributed</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Yelp</td>
        <td>Reviews and ratings of Oakland parks through Yelp API</td>
        <td>Smallest dataset. Only 12 parks in Oakland have Yelp reviews</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Google Maps</td>
        <td>Average ratings and number of reviews of each Oakland park</td>
        <td>Could not get Google's API so limited to only the ratings. But had much more data points than 12 (119 to be exact!)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>City of Oakland</td>
        <td>Map of parks dataset - Official Park Names</td>
        <td>Dataset had typos and inconsistencies. This data source was not used in the final analysis, but did aid in some cross-checking</td>
